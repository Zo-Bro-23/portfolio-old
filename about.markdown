This is my portfolio **website**. I will be posting my exceptionally great works like ***Cartoons, Writeups, Essays, Drawings, Posters, Videos, Programs, Apps, etc.*** in this **website**. If you would like to contact me [click here](http://localhost:4000/portfolio/contact/ "That's right, click here"). I used the open source tools [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com "The open source tool for easily creating websites"), [GitHub](https://github.com "The open source tool for collaborating over projects"), and [Git](https://git-scm.com "The open source tool for keeping versions of a project") for making this website.
