## Philiosopher's perspective on creation of the world

Change to:

The world was created for a purpose and everything in it plays a role in sustaining it. Be it a star like our sun that gives light and hope to so many, or a star far away from the Earth, that helps a tiny bird find its way home. Nobody is big or small, nobody bigger or smaller. Everybody is equally important. The sun needs to serve its purpose of being the sun, and the star its purpose of being the guide, for the universe to sustain its purpose of existance. 

Anything that happens happens for a reason, to take the world one step ahead of where it was yesterday. Anything that you do will directly influence everybody in some way. If you think back on your life, an insignificant decision that you took 20 years back might be why you are standing where you are today, be it a good position or bad. Nobody can tell what role they play to the world, but someday, somebody might be able to. Human life, though the most sophisticated species there is (again, we donâ€™t know anything about anything), has still not been able to figure out what they will one day do to the world and even the point of their existence. Though evolution has been able to increase the amount of cognition in animals from the tiny nucleus of a phytoplankton to the enormous brains of humans, it has yet not been able to give life the power of understanding its purpose of existence. We just live on, hoping that we are bringing good to the universe with our every action...
