Activity: Human achievement

Recently, Elon Musk's SpaceX launched a rocket with a manned probe inside it. The probe went into orbit and successfully docked with the ISS, resulting in the ISS astronauts receiving two visitors. A few centuries back, space was an unknown realm to us and a wish to go to space was considered a wish to die young. So it most certainly is a great human achievement to travel to space and back. Only three governments have managed to do it so far. For a private company like SpaceX to step up and take the responsibility to send astronauts to space requires a whole lot of courage and that is what makes this achievement so great.
