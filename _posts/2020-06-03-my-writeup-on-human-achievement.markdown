# Question:

## Part one:

For this assessment task you will need to ***demonstrate*** your understanding of mapping by creating your own fictional map. You can be creative with the design of your map but you need to use a range of conventions within your map to ***demonstrate*** your understanding.
Your map needs to include the following features:

- a title
- a scale
- direction
- a key for the symbols on the map
- grid references
- physical features (eg rivers mountains).

Spend some time researching examples of fictional maps in works of literature (for example, the *Lord of the Rings* books) to give you an idea of how you can use your imagination to create a really interesting map. Make sure you plan the design of your map carefully by drawing rough sketches before you complete it properly. Your map could be drawn by hand or created using a computer. Ensure that the quality of presentation and accuracy is high before you submit it.
